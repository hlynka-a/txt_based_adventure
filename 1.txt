You slowly open your eyes. You're in your bed, your blankets neatly covering
your still body. A faint sound in the background grows louder and louder, 
and you realize that your alarm clock is ringing, signalling you to get up.

It's 7am, but you just went to bed at 6am (after a long night of playing 
Call of Duty with some ten-year olds online). Exhausted, you know you 
have to get ready for work, but would do anything to stay in bed. 

What do you do?

1. You ignore the clock, and stay in bed.
2. You get up and turn off the clock.
