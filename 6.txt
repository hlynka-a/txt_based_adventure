You reach over and press the button to turn off the alarm
clock. To your surprise, it doesn't turn off. The button must
be broken. The alarm keeps ringing. Louder and louder.

You figure you could go downstairs and get a tool to fix the
alarm clock, or you could go back to sleep and try to sleep
through the noise.

1. Go downstairs and get some tools.
2. Go back to sleep.
