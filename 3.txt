You get out of bed, but notice that today is actually Sunday,
and you don't have anything to do today. That's good news,
you could use some extra sleep. But the alarm clock is still
ringing, and at this point it's painful to listen to. 

Still tired, you could either reach over and shut off the 
alarm, or you could ignore it and go back to bed.

1. Reach over and turn off the alarm.
2. Decide you are too lazy to reach two feet to your left,
   and go back to sleep.
