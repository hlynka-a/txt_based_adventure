You go back to bed. You close your eyes and smile to yourself,
snug in your blankets and sheets. You will dream of rainbows 
and lollipops and magical ponies, among other things. This would
make for a wonderful adventure setting for a young child or a
ill-minded adult, but it is all in your mind, and therefore there
isn't any real point to continue.

So that's it. This game wasn't very interesting, was it... maybe
if you got out of bed and continued on with the day, something
more curious would have happened...
