You slowly open your eyes. You're in your bed, your blankets fallen
on the floor. You notice that the alarm clock has stopped ringing,
as the bell must have broken out of overuse. The clock says it is 
now 2pm, and you have clearly overslept and have missed work.

As you force yourself up, you realize today is actually Sunday, and
there is no work today. "Thank goodness," you think, but know you
have a predicament. Do you stay up and continue on with the day, or 
go back to sleep and feel refreshed for tomorrow?

1. You stay up and continue with the day.
2. You go back to bed.
