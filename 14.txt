You go back to the alarm clock, wrench in hand. The alarm is still 
ringing, louder and louder. 

Like a professional, you delicately whack the alarm clock until it
breaks in two. The alarm has stopped. Thank goodness.

Now that the clock is taken care of, you have a choice to make. You
can go downstairs and get something to eat (you remember there was
an old pickle jar in the back of the fridge you don't remember buying)
or you could go back to sleep.

1. Go back to sleep.
2. (not added yet)
