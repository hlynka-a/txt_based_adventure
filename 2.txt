You slowly open your eyes. You're in your bed, your blankets tangled
around you. A faint, familiar sound in the background grows louder and
louder, and you realize that your alarm clock is still ringing, as you forgot
to turn it off earlier.

It's 8am, but you still feel tired, and feel like you need another five minutes
of sleep to function for the rest of the day. 

What do you do?

1. You ignore the clock, and sleep for five more minutes.
2. You get up and turn off the clock.
